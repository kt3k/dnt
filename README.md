# d2n

Prototype for a Deno to Node/canonical TypeScript transform.

This will output tsc compatible code from a Deno codebase that could then be sent to a bundler (or compiled by tsc) for npm distribution.

## CLI Example

```bash
# install
cargo install d2n

# clone a Deno-first repo
git clone https://github.com/dsherret/code-block-writer.git
cd code-block-writer

# run tool and output to ./code-block-writer/npm
d2n mod.ts --out ./npm

# go to output directory, run tsc, and publish
cd npm
tsc mod.ts --target ES2015 --module commonjs --declaration
npm publish
```

The file in *code-block-writer/npm/mod.ts* would contain module specifiers without extensions (in the main codebase they had `.ts` extensions):

```ts
import { CommentChar } from "./comment_char";
import { escapeForWithinString, getStringFromStrOrFunc } from "./utils/string_utils";
```

If you run with `cargo run -- ../code-block-writer/mod.ts --out ../code-block-writer/npm --keep-extensions` it will then contain:

```ts
import { CommentChar } from "./comment_char.js";
import { escapeForWithinString, getStringFromStrOrFunc } from "./utils/string_utils.js";
```

## API Example

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;

use d2n::ModuleSpecifier;
use d2n::transform;
use d2n::TransformOptions;

let output_files = transform(TransformOptions {
  entry_point: ModuleSpecifier::from_file_path(PathBuf::from("./mod.ts")).unwrap(),
  keep_extensions: false,
  loader: None, // use the default loader
}).await?;

for output_file in output_files {
  // use these properties on output_file
  output_file.file_path;
  output_file.file_text;
}
```

## Future Goals

1. Support Deno.json to get compiler options.
1. Handle mapping from remote specifiers to bare specifiers and transforming them in the file.
1. Handle dynamic imports (at least ones that are statically analyzable and maybe warn on others)
1. Support creating or modifying a package.json and using that for publish.
1. Remove `@deno-types` and type reference directive comments. Currently leaves them as-is, but better to remove them in case the npm package gets re-consumed in Deno.

Notes from Kitson:

- We would need to rewrite triple slash references
- We might need to deal with the types in the tsconfig.json
- How do we handle remote URLs, data URLs and blob dynamic imports?
  - David: Just changed it to download everything for now, but in the future we can implement remote URL -> bare specifier mapping. Ideally this will be automatic, but in some cases the user will need to specify a bare specifier to use.
  - David: We could probably output data URLs to a file.
  - David: Blob dynamic imports... I'm not sure. Dynamic imports will be a problem if they're not statically analyzable, but we can warn the user about that when it happens.
- We should go from ./foo.ts to ./foo.js by default, with a flag to go from ./foo.ts to ./foo, assume people are supporting a browser or ESM Node.js
  - David: I'll change this to be the default later.
